Welcome to the repository for my thesis dissertation on Optical Character Recognition From Handwritten Bangla Texts. Please note that I am currently in the process of finalizing four research publications that originated from this work. Due to intellectual property considerations and to prevent the possibility of code theft prior to publication, I have chosen not to share the research code at this time.

**Thesis Dissertation**:
- The full text of my thesis dissertation is available in the [Thesis Dissertation of Faias Satter.pdf] file.

I am committed to open science and sharing my research findings. Once my research publications are complete and the results are published, I intend to release the associated code publicly. In the meantime, if you have any questions or would like to discuss my research, please feel free to contact me at [faiaspromit@gmail.com].

Thank you for your understanding and interest in my work.
